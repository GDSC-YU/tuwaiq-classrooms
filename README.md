Tuwaiq Rooms is a student-made project at Al-Yamamah University that allows all university affiliates to check the schedule of any room in the Tuwaiq building. We wrote it in a way that reads data from a JSON file and displays it in an organized manner, so that students can take advantage of empty classes efficiently.

## Features ‚≠ê

- View any room schedule on any selected day of the week
- Display of the schedule is simple and organized
- Access the schedule from any device (responsive design)
- Enjoy the convenience of using it as a Progressive Web App (PWA)!
- Easy to update at the start of each semester by effortlessly running the [Excel Rooms Converter](https://github.com/GDSC-YU/excel-rooms-converter)
